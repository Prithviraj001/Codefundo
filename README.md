What we are planning to do :
	Prediction of Disasters using Fractal System
  
What are Fractals :
	Fractals are numeric values which are used to predict natural disaster based on some factors.More the value more likely a disaster can happen.
Every disaster has unique way of calculating fractal values depending on the factors on which the disaster is depending. 

Working :
	Our project idea is to run a program to calculate fractals for every hour on specific location all over the globe and store them in satellite.
	These values cannot be stored in servers on earth because the server's location might also be a site of a disaster.
	Every buildings in the world should be installed with an alert alarm  that is triggered when the fractals values are above the safe zone.
	These alert alarms should be connected to the program running in the satellite,
	There are two levels of warning in case of a disaster at a location. These warnings are based on the fractal value. 
	If fractal value is sufficiently high at a location, first level of warning i.e the public is alerted that there are slight chances of a disaster to happen and the alert alarms in the expected region of disaster is triggered. 
	If it's extremely high, second level of warning(serious issue) like SMS bomb should be delivered to the public who are to be affected and corresponding alerts should also be sent to disaster mangement organisation of that location.
